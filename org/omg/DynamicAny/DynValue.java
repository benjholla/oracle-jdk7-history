/**
    * DynValue objects support the manipulation of IDL non-boxed value types.
    * The DynValue interface can represent both null and non-null value types.
    * For a DynValue representing a non-null value type, the DynValue's components comprise
    * the public and private members of the value type, including those inherited from concrete base value types,
    * in the order of definition. A DynValue representing a null value type has no components
    * and a current position of -1.
    * <P>Warning: Indiscriminantly changing the contents of private value type members can cause the value type
    * implementation to break by violating internal constraints. Access to private members is provided to support
    * such activities as ORB bridging and debugging and should not be used to arbitrarily violate
    * the encapsulation of the value type.
